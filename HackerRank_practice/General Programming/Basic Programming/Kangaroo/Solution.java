// Case 1: v1 <= v2

// Case2 : v1 > v2
// x2 - x1 represents the distance between the 2 kangaroos
// v2 - v1 represents the difference in velocities between the 2 kangaroos. It also represents how much closer the kangaroos get in each step (until they either meet or 1 kangaroo jumps over the other)
// If the distance between the kangaroos (x2 - x1) is divisible by how much closer they get in each step (v2 - v1), then they will land at the same location at the same time. Otherwise, 1 kangaroo will jump over the other and they will never be at the same location at the same time.
