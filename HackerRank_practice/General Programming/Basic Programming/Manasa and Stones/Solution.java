if (a == b), the last stone can have only 1 value, which is (n - 1) * a

if (a != b), we notice that 2 consecutive stones can have a difference of "a" or "b". 
In a path, there are n-1 differences representing pairs of adjacent stones. We are not 
interested in where in the path the difference between 2 stones is "a" or "b", since 
changing the order of where the differences occur still results in the same value for 
the last stone. What's important is the # of times the difference between 2 stones is 
"a" and the # of times it's "b". For a >= 0 and b >= 0, there are n-1 ways to choose 
"a" and "b" such that a + b == n-1, so there are n-1 possibilities for the last stone.

To print the n-1 possible values for the last stone, we iterate through the n-1 combinations 
of "a" and b" and calculate the value of the last stone for each combination.

 Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
