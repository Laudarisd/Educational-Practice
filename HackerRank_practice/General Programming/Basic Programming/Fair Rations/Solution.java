// Idea: Loop through the array. For every person with an odd number of bread, we distribute 1 bread to current
//       person, and 1 bread to next person. If last person has odd number of bread, there is no solution.
//       Otherwise, everyone has even number of bread, and we print how much bread was distributed.

// Time Complexity: O(n)
