// Algorithm: 
//  1 - Notice there is a special restriction on the range of values in the array: values are between 0 and 100.
//  2 - Since the order of elements in our array does not matter, we can just keep the counts of each number.
//  3 - Create a new 100-element "counts" array to store the counts of each number.
//  4 - In our "counts" array, the adjacent pair with the largest sum is our final solution.
//  5 - This is because the original numbers represented by the 2 adjacent slots in counts[] can be used to create a 
//      maximal solution

// Time complexity: O(n)
