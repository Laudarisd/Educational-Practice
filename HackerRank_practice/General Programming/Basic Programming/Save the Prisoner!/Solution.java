/*

We start off at some random prisoner S and try to distribute M candies. We could just do 
S + M to see which prisoner we end up at. However, we may have more candies than prisoners, 
so we loop back around to the first prisoner by doing the % N where N is number of prisoners.

Each +1 and -1 that you see in the equation is to fix the off-by-one problems that exist 
since prisoners are counted from 1 to N while modular arithmetic is counted from 0.
