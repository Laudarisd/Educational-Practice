 Time Complexity: O(n + k)
Space Complexity: O(k)

We keep track of the mod values in buckets for each number we read. We can do this 
by creating k buckets where bucket "i" counts each number "n" where n % k = i.

Notice that each bucket has a corresponding "complement" bucket. That is, if we take 
the mod value of one bucket and add it to the mod value of another bucket, we get "k".

Bucket   Complement Bucket
------   -----------------
   0            0
   1           k-1
   2           k-2
   3           k-3
        ...
  k-3           3
  k-2           2
  k-1           1

As we come across each number, we find its corresponding complement bucket. Each number in 
this complement bucket can be paired with our original number to create a sum divisible by *k*

static int divisibleSumPairs(int n, int k, int[] ar) {
    int [] bucket = new int[k];
    int count = 0;
    for (int value : ar) {
        int modValue = value % k;
        count += bucket[(k - modValue) % k]; // adds # of elements in complement bucket.
        bucket[modValue]++;                  // saves in bucket.
    }
    return count;
}
