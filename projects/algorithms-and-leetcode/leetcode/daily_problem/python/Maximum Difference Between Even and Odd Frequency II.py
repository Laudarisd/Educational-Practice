"""
You are given a string s and an integer k. Your task is to find the maximum difference between the frequency of two characters, freq[a] - freq[b], in a substring subs of s, such that:

subs has a size of at least k.
Character a has an odd frequency in subs.
Character b has an even frequency in subs.
Return the maximum difference.

Note that subs can contain more than 2 distinct characters.
